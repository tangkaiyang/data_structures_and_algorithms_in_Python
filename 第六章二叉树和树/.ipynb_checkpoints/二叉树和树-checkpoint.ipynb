    "# 第六章 二叉树和树\n",
    "\n",
    "复杂结构中最简单的一类结构,称为**树形结构**.\n",
    "\n",
    "树和二叉树,都属于树形结构\n",
    "\n",
    "树形结构也是由结点(结构中的逻辑单元,可用于保存数据)和结点之间的连接关系(一种后继关系)构成,但其结构与线性结构(表)不同,最重要的特征包括:\n",
    "- 一个结构如果不空,其中就存在着唯一的起始节点,称为__树根__(root).\n",
    "- 按结构的连接关系,树根外的其余结点都有且只有一个**前驱**(这点与线性结构一样).但另一方面,一个结点可以有0各或者多个后继(因此与线性结构不同).另外,在非空的树结构中一定有写结点并不连接到其他结点.这种结点与表的尾结点性质类似,但在一个树结构里可以存在多个这种结点.\n",
    "- 结构里的所有结点都在树根结点通过后继关系可达的结点集合里.换句话说,从树根结点出发,经过若干次后继关系可以到达结构中的任一个结点\n",
    "- 结点之间的联系不会形成循环关系,这也说明,结点之间的联系形成了一种序,但一般而言不想线性表那样形成了一个全序.\n",
    "- 从这种结构里的任意两个不同结点出发,通过后继关系可达的两个结点集合,或者互不相交,或者一个集合是另一个集合的子集.\n",
    "\n",
    "树形结构的重要特征使之与其他更复杂的结构不同.此外,在树形结构里的结点形成了一种层次结构,可以用于表示各种常见的层次性关系.\n",
    "\n",
    "## 6.1 二叉树:概念和性质\n",
    "\n",
    "__二叉树__是一种最简单的树形结构,其特点是树中每个结点至多关联到两个后继结点,也就是说,一个结点的关联结点数可以为0,1或2.另一个特点是一个结点关联的后继结点明确地分左右,或为其做关联结点,或为其右关联结点.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 6.1.1 概念和性质\n",
    "**定义**(二叉树)二叉树是结点的有穷集合.这个集合或者是空集,或者其中有一个称为根结点的特殊结点,其余结点分属两棵不相交的二叉树,这两棵二叉树分别是原二叉树(或说是原二叉树的根结点)的左子树和右子树.\n",
    "\n",
    "二叉树是一种递归结构(根据上述定义)\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 几个基本概念\n",
    "\n",
    "不包含任何结点的二叉树称为__空树__;只包含一个结点的二叉树是一棵**单点树**;一般而言,一棵二叉树可以包含任意(但又穷多)个结点.\n",
    "\n",
    "一棵二叉树的根结点称为该树的子树根结点的__父结点__;与之对应,子树的根结点称为二叉树树根结点的**子结点**.注意,父结点和子结点的概念是相对的.\n",
    "\n",
    "可认为从父结点到子结有一条连线,称为从父结点到子结点的边.注意,这种边有方向,形成一种单方向的父结点/子结点关系(__父子关系__).基于父子关系可以定义其传递关系,称为**祖先**/__子孙关系__,它决定了一个结点的**祖先结点**,或__子孙结点__.另外,父结点相同的两个结点互为**兄弟结点**.易见,一棵二叉树(或其中子树)的根结点r是这棵树(这棵子树)中所有其他结点的祖先结点,而这些结点都是r的子孙结点.\n",
    "\n",
    "在二叉树里有些结点的两颗子树都为空,没有子结点.这种结点称为__树叶__(结点).树中其余结点称为**分支结点**.注意:分支结点可以只有一个分支(一个子结点).对于二叉树,只有一个分支时必须说明它是其左分支还是右分支.\n",
    "\n",
    "一个结点的子结点个数称为该结点的__度数__.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 路径,结点的层和树的高度\n",
    "\n",
    "### 6.1.2 抽象数据类型\n",

    "### 6.1.3 遍历二叉树\n",
    "\n",
    "两种基本方式:\n",
    "- 深度优先遍历,顺着一条路径尽可能向前探索,必要时回溯.对于二叉树,最基本的回溯情况时检查完一个叶结点.由于无路可走,只能回头\n",

    "\n",
    "遍历左子树(L),遍历右子树(R)和访问根结点(D)\n",

    "- 中根序遍历(LDR),对称序,得到__对称序列(中根序列)__\n",
    "- 后根序遍历(LRD).得到**后根序列**\n",
    "\n",
    "命题 如果知道了一棵二叉树的对称序列,又知道另一遍序列,就可以唯一确定这个二叉树\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 宽度优先遍历\n",
    "又称为__按层次顺序遍历__,这样遍历产生的结点序列称为二叉树的**层次序列**\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 遍历与搜索\n",
    "\n",
    "在状态空间的搜索过程中记录从一个状态到另一状态的联系,将其看作结点间链接,就会发现这种搜索过程实际上构造出了一棵树,称为__搜索树__.\n",
